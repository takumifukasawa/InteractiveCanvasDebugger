Instructions:
Don’t worry - making a Privacy Policy is not that hard and should only take a few minutes for most apps. Just follow the instructions below:

Go to File > Make a Copy to make a copy of this document
Select “Share it with the same people” to make sure your privacy policy is visible to others →

Replace the name of the document with your app name. For instance, if your app name is “Dr. Music”, you would name the document “Dr. Music Privacy Policy”

Fill out the document with your Privacy Policy. You may want to use one of the various online Privacy Policy tools that aid in creating one.

Delete these instructions, and then use the URL of this document as your Privacy Policy URL in the Actions Console
Make sure your privacy policy has its share settings set to “Anyone with the link can view” →
